# SPSSINC MODIFY OUTPUT
## Modify output titles and other aspects of objects in the View
 This procedure allows you to modify the text of specified   items in the outline pane of the Viewer as well as the titles (such   as pivot table titles) or text (such as for title items) of the assoc  iated items. Replacement text can contain html or rtf formatting nota  tion. Optionally, you can hide specified items and you can insert pag  e breaks before specified title items.  Using included custom functio  ns, selected items can be exported, and there is extra page break fun  ctionality.
